# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on: Developing 'FlashAI', a React-based web app that uses AI to transform student notes into shareable flashcards. This project leverages OpenAI's GPT model for content generation and implements machine learning models for feature enhancements like keyword highlighting.<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: Collaborative projects that aim to integrate AI into everyday learning and productivity tools.<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning: How to integrate Lambda 2 or other large language models into my application, aiming to generate flashcards locally. This would allow me to bypass the cost of using external APIs, and bring the processing in-house, leading to more control and potentially better performance.<br>üí¨ Ask me about: How I utilize Python and JavaScript to build full-stack AI applications.<br>‚ö° Fun fact: The best advice I ever received was to see challenges as opportunities. It's a mindset that's vital in AI, where every problem is a chance for innovation.
